## 📚 Project Description
  In a constantly evolving legal landscape, lawyers and law students frequently struggle to navigate complex legal statutes and accurately identify relevant articles for various cases. This challenge often leads to inefficiencies, increased time spent on research, and potential oversights in legal analysis.
  The application aims to assist lawyers and law students in navigating the complexities of legal statutes and articles relevant to their cases. By inputting a case description, users can quickly receive a list of applicable laws and legal provisions. For instance, if the input is "pelanggaran UU ITE terkait pornografi," the application would identify violations such as "melanggar Pasal 45 Ayat 1. Pasal 27 Ayat 1 UU RI No. 1 Tahun 2024, ancaman hukuman berupa penjara hingga 12 tahun atau denda sebesar Rp 6 miliar." This tool serves dual purposes: it aids legal professionals in developing effective strategies and acts as an educational resource for law students, enhancing their comprehension of legal provisions and their practical applications. With a user-friendly interface and access to a comprehensive database of legal regulations, the application is designed to streamline the process of identifying relevant legal solutions while fostering a deeper understanding of significant legal concepts.
